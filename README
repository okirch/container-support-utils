This project is about utilities that help with diagnosing software
issues in containers. Rather than rebuilding your container and
adding lots of stuff to it, you may want to "go to" your container
the way you log into a server, and strace your application, view
its log files, fiddle with the config files, etc.

So far, this project contains the following

 ns-exec and savelog
	ns-exec is a bit like nsenter on (a low dosis of) steroids.

	It can be used to start shell sessions inside a running
	container. You can mount a host side directory with debugging
	tools inside this session, and retrieve log files for
	later analysis.

 pam_container
	A Linux PAM module that you can use to automatically
	place login/ssh sessions etc within an existing container.
	For details, see README.pam

 sidecar container
 	This is still very much WIP. The goal is to have a container
	image that you can attach to any container you need to
	debug, and run your diagnostics on it.

 sidecar-console and sidecar-shell
 	More of an experiment in combining a remote shell
	service and the functionality of ns-exec described
	above. Not very secure yet, and not really recommended
	for use.

 wormhole
	This is a rather different type of beast in that it's
	not about containers per se. Instead, this is a tool
	that uses the kernel's container capabilities to create
	a way of packaging applications with some or all of their
	dependencies, and still make the system appear as seamless
	as possible to the application.
