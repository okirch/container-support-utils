Things to be done

Wormhole

 - config handling:
    - re-read config files after SIGHUP
    - allow for (command) profiles to be enabled always, and only within
      certain contexts
 - time out requests that do not complete
 - daemon should use a pid file
 - make the logging more useful (and redirect any less interesting stuff to a log file)
 - client should pass its current namespace to the daemon so that we can detect
   which ns it runs in.

sidecar

 - testing this with kubernetes. Right now, I've only tried this
   with podman

 - testing this with several containers inside one pod

 - bugfixing

 - command line parsing. We want to make the port number
   configurable

 - extract the admin password from an environment variable, so
   that podman/kubernetes/etc can pass that secret

 - add a /fs service that lets you view random files inside the
   running container

Console

 - use libssh to provide session layer
