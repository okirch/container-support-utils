Things to be done

Wormhole

 - support config file for profile definition
 - daemon should use a pid file
 - make the logging more useful (and redirect any less interesting stuff to a log file)


sidecar

 - testing this with kubernetes. Right now, I've only tried this
   with podman

 - testing this with several containers inside one pod

 - bugfixing

 - command line parsing. We want to make the port number
   configurable

 - extract the admin password from an environment variable, so
   that podman/kubernetes/etc can pass that secret

 - add a /fs service that lets you view random files inside the
   running container

Console

 - use libssh to provide session layer
